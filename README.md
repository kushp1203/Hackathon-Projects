All my projects made in hackathons

-Stock prediction uses the data from yahoo's stock API and machine learning 
whichs traces the data for the stock and gives a forecast for 2 days. The accuracy
is measured as a confidence interval as well.

-WashMe (located in HACKJA folder, I am bad at naming sorry) a prototype app that can scan washtags on the back of clothing
and use image recognition to tell you how to wash the clothes properly.
